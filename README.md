<p>
  User Karen creates a ticket:

</p>
<br />
<br />
<h3 align="center">Ticket assignment</h3>
<br />
<p>
  Support agent John Doe logs in.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<br />
<br />
<h3 align="center">Communication</h3>
<br />
<p>
  Agent John sees this is Sev-A emergency ticket and has to reassign ticket to a System Administrator.
</p>
<p>
  He makes sure to leave a proper message:
</p>
<p>

</p>
<br />
<br />
<h3 align="center">Working the issue</h3>
<br />
<p>
  System Administrator agent Jane Doe logs in:
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f810080-abe7-4641-8e6f-c912113280fb" height="75%" width="100%" alt="Sys admin agent login"/>
</p>
<p>
  Agent Jane works the issue and communicates back to agent John.
</p>
<p>
  She also makes sure to switch the status of the issue from open to resolved:
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a767362-6e8a-44ea-b96e-828412e8ac0a" height="75%" width="100%" alt="Working the issue"/>
</p>
<br />
<br />
<h3 align="center">Resolution</h3>
<br />
<p>
  Support agent John sees in his portal that System Administrator agent Jane has left him a message and that the ticket is now closed:>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<br />
<br />
<p>
  This was a very simplistic scenario of the creation of a ticket by a user, how the ticket is assigned and displays the communication of a ticket between agents; subsequently resulting in a resolution.
</p>
<p>
  There are additional scenarios that can also happen while a ticket is being assessed. A ticket can either be reassigned to a different department, escalated in severeity level, or needs to be both reassigned to a more qualified agent/department to handle the issue, depending on business impacts.
</p>
<p>
  I hope this tutorial helps you understand and have a better general overview of a life-cycle of a ticket. Help desk agents can expect to regularly deal with anywere between 10 to 100 tickets during their day depeneding on the company size.
